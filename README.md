Spring Boot is a way in which you can bootstrap or quickly start up spring applications.

What is Spring Boot?
- Spring f/w + Boot = Bootstrap. Spring Boot lets you bootstrap a Spring application from scratch.
- Spring Boot makes it easy to create stand-alone, production-grade Spring based Applications that you can "just run".

Spring f/w is a huge f/w that does a lot of things for us.
- we need to follow a lot of setup/configuration steps.
- we need to follow multiple deployment steps.
- capability and flexibility of Spring f/w comes at a cost. You need to do a whole lot to have it do what you exactly want.
- since it can do a whole lot, there is not a starting point/guide that shows best practices.
- Spring Boot abstracts these steps.
- thus it is an "opinionated" approach that addresses majority of use cases (80% - 20%).
- convention over configuration (80% - 20% concept).
- output of Spring Boot is a 'ready-to-run' 'stand-alone' product - meaning you don't have to find a servlet container to run it. - it comes w/ a servlet container. When you run it as Java application, it starts that servlet container.
- it is production ready.
